I was born and raised in **San Francisco, CA**.

In my free time, I like to play games like _Valorant_ and _League of Legends_ with friends. My favorite champion in League of Legends is Veigar because he's short like me.

I only have 2 classes left to take and I am currently thinking of taking

## As a programmer...
I do not abide by the famous CSE department saying:
> Start early, start often!

I am a heavy procastinator, but I get things done in a timely manner. However, I recently completed a software engineering internship that developed a greater interest in my career as a software engineer. I have been leetcoding the [Blind 75](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions) to prepare for applying to jobs.

This is also one of my first few experiences using github so check out the README page I made for this class [README Page](README.md). That's all, thanks for reading!
